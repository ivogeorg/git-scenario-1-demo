# Git Scenario 2 Demo

This is the second of a series of videos on using the version-control system [Git](https://git-scm.com/).  

## Demo pull

This is a command that syncs a _local_ repository clone with the remote. It causes the changes to the remote be "pulled" to the local Git development environment.
